        My name is Onwuka Paul, I will like to keep my age a secrete from you just today. 
        That picture you see above is me calling my ancestors and asking them why I am 
        still in Nigeria.<br>
        I am a Nutritionist and I love to help people get the best of themselves healthwise.
        My job is to use staple foods to manage  and cure disease condition privalent around us.
        my strong area is managing Hypertension and diabetes.
        I currently live in Ondo state in Ondo town. The funny thing is that the Ondo indegenes 
        think that Ondo is a City but its just a small town that is still growing. 
        I love the place because its not totally taken over by industrialization. We the 
        people
        and the animals that live here are still very close to nature.
        You can visit if you love nature and solitude.

      <h2>Why did i join Altschool Africa ? </h2><br>
      
      <p>
        I joined Altschool because I want to become a developer and a very good one at that.
        I want to be a developer to assist people to get the best of themselves in area of 
        health, mind and body. communication is the key and
        only means through which knowledge can be transmitted. I want to master the art and make the 
        process of becoming a better person very easy; even if we all know its usually not easy.
